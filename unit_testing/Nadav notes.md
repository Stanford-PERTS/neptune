# Nadav notes

## Pre-meeting

Introduce state of the tool

Target audience

What user testing protocols do you recommend?
    Benefit to doing it in person?

Pros/cons to animation to draw attention?
    pointer to next task
    transparent gray later

## Orientation

Think about exactly how understandable "growth mindset" is.
Within bullet line height needs to be tighter.
Lots of whitespace at the top.
Stock photo is too stock.
Quote and headline is too generic. Use a name or initials.
Research paragraph is too wide (maybe it should be shorter)
Register Now can be fixed position, maybe in navbar
How It Works is great, put it higher.
(Typo after "students&mdash; ")
Our Goals is great, maybe add funders.

Home page in general:
    highlight navbar based on current location
    navbar link would drive people to orientation page
    "Now Recruiting" isn't an action (e.g. join a program) could also be a noun for parity with "educator resources".

## Registration and Dashboard

Let people know what the registration steps are
10 char password? really?
Explain why we need location or drop it... "it's probably totally fine"
Could incorporate program registration into the checkpoint framework to let people know what to expect.
"Let's Go!" makes me think I'll start a process. But not sure where it's going to go.
If someone else is responsible do I have to go find them?
(Task goes green) "That was nice"
Undo option for agreeing to statements? Realized they need more time...
It's mixing together profile information with a set of tasks...
Make things as parallel as possible, e.g. if they all had a button
Quiz: seems like an error (need to explain)
Video task: mixed messages re task/process, wasn't sure what to do.
    Like the idea of a training task, but the way it looks, looks like a different kind of thing. "Your first task is to watch this video"
    It's so little... do some of that in text ("All changes saved"), and some in design.
    Completion bar that advances with every task...
Not sure the commitment list needs to be separate. They should make sense as conceptual units, or totally meaningless groups of same size.

## User Testing Process

With unfamiliar people, let them loose, just tell them to think out loud. Basic research principles.
Set them a scenario.

## Animation?

Collapse things that are done (for things that need later reference, the collapsed row could contain it)
Check out Google's material guide.
It does need some way to address feeling lost.

## On Rails?

It could be psychologically on rails. Number the tasks. Give readout 3 or 10 done.
Could be stronger in terms of what complete and incomplete look like.
The "you've done it all" thing is great. Show it disabled rather than coming from nowhere.

Visually in the lists, the heirarchy is ambiguous. Could use more structure. Other ways of drawing attention: type size. Title of each task can be bigger, instructions smaller, action area less indented. Do the job with as few style techniques as possible.

=================

## Debrief

Generally more context on why actions is needed.
    - Why you have to search for your org

Make program registration look like an org task

Put comitment task in survey

Add "get results" checkpoint

Move video to the right column, or into welcome modal

More focus on current task, maybe with text color, maybe with finger.
